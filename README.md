# Social-network-analysis

A network of politicians on Facebook is analyzed (Dataset from https://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-politician.php). 
The nodes correspond to some blue verified politician Facebook pages, while the links are the mutual likes among these pages. The time of extraction is November 2017.The network is an undirected network. The following computations have been done: 
Analysis of the degree distribution and of the density
Analysis of the ECDF and the ECCDF curves
Degree assortativity
Analysis of the connected components
Nodes's centrality
Transitivity
Brdges, local bridges, almost local bridges
Attribute assortativity
Community detection (Louvain algorithm, greedy algorithm)
